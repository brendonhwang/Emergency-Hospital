# Emergency-Hospital
This project demonstrates a Power BI Emergency Department (ED) dashboard designed to support hospital executives, emergency department leadership, and operational managers with real-time, decision-oriented insights.

## 1. Project Overview and Objective
This project demonstrates a Power BI Emergency Department (ED) dashboard designed to support hospital executives, emergency department leadership, and operational managers with real-time, decision-oriented insights.
The dashboard provides an end-to-end view of emergency department activity — from patient arrival through discharge — focusing on operational efficiency, patient flow, acuity, and resource utilization.


Important Note: All data used in this project is synthetically generated using AI.  The purpose is demonstration, visualization design, and analytics capability — not clinical or operational decision-making.

#### 1.1 Intended Audience
* Hospital Executives (CEO, COO, CMO)
* Emergency Department Directors & Managers
* Hospital Operations & Quality Teams
* Data & BI Leaders in Healthcare
* Portfolio reviewers / hiring managers

####  1.2 Business Questions This Dashboard Answers
* How busy is the emergency department by month, day, and arrival mode?
* What are the most common chief complaints and acuity levels?
* How long do patients spend at each stage of the ED process?
* Where are the bottlenecks (triage, room assignment, imaging, discharge)?
* How do visit duration and acuity trends change over time?
* What percentage of visits arrive by ambulance vs walk-in?
* How are patients distributed by age group, race, and severity?


## 2. Key Dashboard Pages & Functionality
